# codebook

This codebook is part of an assignment in my data analysis class. The assignment was to find and wrangle a dataset, prepare it for "public" use, and create a codebook for the dataset to serve as a reference guide for anyone who wants to use this data.

The final data is called maternal_health_2014.csv and maternal_health_2014.rdata.

The World Bank data is called WB_MMR_2014.csv.

The UNICEF data is from the file Maternal-and-Newborn-Coverage-Database-December-2022.xlsx. I separated the data from this spreadsheet into seven different files to import the data to R. These files are called anc1.xlsx, anc4.xlsx, csec.xlsx, instdel.xlsx, pncmom.xlsx, pncnb.xlsx, sab.xlsx.

This repository also contains codebook-assignment.pdf which contains the full assignment instructions, codebook.Rproj which is the code used to clean the data and prepare for the creation of the codebook, codebook.Rmd which is the R Markdown file used to create the codebook, and codebook.pdf which is the final codebook.
